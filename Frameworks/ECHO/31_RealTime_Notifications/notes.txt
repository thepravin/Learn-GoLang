    - if only want to send notification then use SSE. because, notifications are 
    one way communications.
    - zero re-connection logic.
    - server to client communication.
    - If the connection drops, the browser automatically tries to reconnect.

websockets :
    - chat applications.
    - websockets are bi-directional communications.
    - You have to write code to handle reconnections.
